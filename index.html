        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p> I graduated from Virginia Tech's Pamplin College of Business in May 2022 with two degrees 
            in Business Information Technology and Finance, and a minor in Economics. Immediately after graduation, I worked 
            in McLean, VA as a Federal Technology Risk Management Associate on a variety of IT audit readiness, segregation of duties, 
            ICAM, and inventory management projects at KPMG over 2 years.</p>

        <p>Starting in August 2024, I will begin to pursue a Masters in Data Science 
            and Analytics at Georgetown, aiming to further my education regarding
             machine learning, database management, statsitics, and natural process languages.</p>

            <p>1st Engagement: As a TRM associate, I was responsible for researching the current-state 
                of the DoD federal agency I was under contract for, and solving issues regarding segregation  
                of duties (SoD). This resulted in me supporting the creation of an SoD governance document  
                that was accepted by the agency.
            </p>

            <p>2nd Engagement: I am currently responsible for supporting a DoD federal agency with 
                their IT audit-readiness goals for fiscal year 2023. While physically visiting clients sites 
                across the US, I walkthrough and test the entirety of each site's SAP IT system controls for inter-site 
                discrepancies, system errors, or internal control gaps.</p>

            <p>As a programming counselor, I was responsible for instructing campers
                aged 6-11 in Scratch, and campers aged 12-18 in Python. I used the built-in 
                python platform within Processing 3 to teach middle and high school students 
                the basics of programming (variables, syntax, for loops, while loops, functions, 
                classes) so that they could ultimately build their own game by the end of 
                each two week camp session.

            <p>As a requirements analyst in the creation of a course management program,

                their validation rules, access rules, and how the user would interact
                with each page. When the webpage was created by the developer,
                    I used Selenium to ensure each webpage was functioning properly
                    based on the requirements I previously made. This project used
                    the agile method, involving 4 sprints throughout the semester.</p>

            <p>A user must choose start and destination cities, along with a maximum travel radius

                radius dropdown is capped at 1500 miles, and is used in case the user wants to limit 
                the maximum amount of miles traveled for each flight. The final results appear separately 
                and display all cities in the route, total distance traveled, and cost.

                how far each flight can be. The shorter the radius, the more arcs and nodes will be generated. 
                Once the program is run, the GUI displays all airports, as well as a dropdown of all other 
                airports in the system. When the destination airport is clicked, the shortest path  
                (layovers if necessary), capacity, and cost are revealed in a textbox below.
