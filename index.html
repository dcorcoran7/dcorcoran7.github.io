                <p style = "font-size: 15px;">
                    I graduated from Virginia Tech's Pamplin College of Business in May 2022 with two degrees 
                    in Business Information Technology and Finance, and a minor in Economics. I've been working 
                    in McLean, VA as a Federal Technology Risk Management Associate at KPMG for 1.5 years right 
                    after graduation.

                <p style = "font-size: 15px;"></p>
                    Through academic coursework and personal projects, I've gained experience in many programming

                    <p>1st Engagement: As a TRM associate holding a secret-level security clearance, I was 
                        responsible for researching the current-state of the DoD federal agency I was under 
                        contract for, and solving issues regarding segregation of duties (SoD). This resulted 
                        in me supporting the creation of an SoD governance document that was accepted by the agency.
                    </p>

                    <p>2nd Engagement: I am currently responsible for supporting a DoD federal agency with 
                        their IT audit-readiness goals. While physically visiting clients sites across the US, 
                        I walkthrough and test the entirety of each site's SAP IT system controls for inter-site 
                        discrepancies, system errors, or internal control gaps.</p><br>

                        python platform within Processing 3 to teach middle and high school students 
                        the basics of programming (variables, syntax, for loops, while loops, functions, 
                        classes) so that they could ultimately build their own game by the end of

                    <p>As a requirements analyst in the creation of a course management program,
                        I was responsible for documenting what fields appear on each webpage,
                        their validation rules, access rules, and how the user would interact
                        with each page. When the webpage was created by the developer,
                            I used Selenium to ensure each webpage was functioning properly
                            based on the requirements I previously made. This project used
                            the agile method, involving 4 sprints throughout the semester.</p>

                    <p>I was tasked with creating a database-driven “review management” module for

                            creation, modification, and analysis.</p>

                        the maximum amount of miles traveled for each flight. The final results appear separately

                        Once the program is run, the GUI displays all airports, as well as a dropdown of all other 
                        airports in the system. When the destination airport is clicked, the shortest path  
                        (layovers if necessary), capacity, and cost are revealed in a textbox below.
