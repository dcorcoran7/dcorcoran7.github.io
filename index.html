        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p> I graduated from Virginia Tech's Pamplin College of Business in May 2022 with two degrees 
            in Business Information Technology and Finance, and a minor in Economics. Immediately after graduation, I worked 
            in McLean, VA as a Federal Technology Risk Management Associate on a variety of IT Audit readiness, Segreagtion of Duties, 
            ICAM, and inventory management projects at KPMG over 2.0 years.</p>

        <p>Starting in August 2024, I will begin to pursue a Master in Data Science 
            at Georgretown, aiming to further my education regarding machine learning, 
            database management, statsitics, and natural process languages.</p>

            <h3>KPMG </h3>

            <div class="job">
                <div class="jobTitle">Federal Technology Risk Management Associate</div>
                <div class="jobLength">July 2022 - Present</div>
            </div>
            <p>1st Engagement: As a TRM associate, I was 
                responsible for researching the current-state of the DoD federal agency I was under 
                contract for, and solving issues regarding segregation of duties (SoD). This resulted 
                in me supporting the creation of an SoD governance document that was accepted by the agency.
            </p>

            <p>2nd Engagement: I am currently responsible for supporting a DoD federal agency with 
                their IT audit-readiness goals for fiscal year 2023. While physically visiting clients sites 
                across the US, I walkthrough and test the entirety of each site's SAP IT system controls for inter-site 
                discrepancies, system errors, or internal control gaps.</p>

            <p>Miscellaneous:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Living Green and API Business Resource Groups</li>
                <li>KPMG Culture Catalyst</li>
                <li>KPMG Health Equity Hackathon - 3rd Place </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>TIC </h3>

            <div class="job">
                <div class="jobTitle">Python Programming Counseler</div>
                <div class="jobLength">June 2021 - August 2021</div>
            </div>
            <p>As a programming counselor, I was responsible for instructing campers
                aged 6-11 in Scratch, and campers aged 12-18 in Python. I used the built-in 
                python platform within Processing 3 to teach middle and high school students 
                the basics of programming (variables, syntax, for loops, while loops, functions, 
                classes) so that they could ultimately build their own game by the end of 
                each two week camp session.

        <p>These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:</p>

        <p>My email addy is <a href="mailto:tom@github.com">tom@github.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Crazy linking action</h2>

        <p>I get 10 times more traffic from <a href="http://google.com/" title="Google">Google</a> than from<br>
        <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo Search">Yahoo</a> or <a href="http://search.msn.com/" title="MSN Search">MSN</a>.</p>
